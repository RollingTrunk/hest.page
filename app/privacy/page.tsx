Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

        <p className={styles.text}><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
        <p className={styles.text}>In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice" className={styles.link}>"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>
        <p className={styles.text}>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

          <p className={styles.text}>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

        <p className={styles.text}><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section <a href="#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice" className={styles.link}>"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

        <p className={styles.text}>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <p className={styles.text}>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
